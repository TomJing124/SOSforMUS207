				<div><h1> The Sound of Silence</h1></div>
				<p> Sound! It’s invisible, it’s intangible, yet it's one of our most important, most delicate senses. In minute proportions it might as well not be there, but in extreme amounts, it is a bomb going off. We are here to the shadow of sound, silence.
				</p>
				<p> Delicate intricate waveforms, composed of nothing but ripples in the airwaves, they are responsible for beauty and art in the form of music. Generated from strings, drums, reeds and many many more, this elegant, pleasant side of sound is paralleled with noise, the unwanted sounds. While nearly identical displayed in a waveform but decoded by our mind as irritants, pollutants, rackets. Noise is the unwanted sounds that we are forced to live with, construction, traffic, or just a sour note, for every sound that pleases us there is one that turns us off. However, there is another side to sound, unbounded by personal tastes but strictly undesired, there is too much sound. Like ketchup on filet mignon, these deafening waves that carry simply too much energy destroying any intricacies of itself, this undesirable sound unlike noise, turns us off as it can cause damage to our ear, or worse, ruining an otherwise beautiful melody.
				</p>
				<p> We are exploring the unsung hero in music production and performance. The lack of sound in music, from performers with their advanced custom earplugs to everyday people using passive noise cancellation headphones to focus and enjoy what they like untainted by our noisy world.

				<h1>A Brief History</h1>
				<p> An invention brought on by necessity, sound control came from an unlikely source, armed warfare. Ever since the invention of the firearm, a clear problem arose, having a small explosion powerful enough to send a 15-gram ball of lead spiralling 200 meters per second towards the enemy sure does create a loud boom. Loud enough it was like a disease that stole your hearing. At about a third if the Union Army soldiers in the revolutionary war reported some sort of hearing loss, from mild to complete degradation. While tolerated by most this disease exploded centuries later. Sparked by necessity some of the world's earliest earplugs rose during WWI where explosions got louder and far more plentiful. Today that same invention, refined over and over, is still used. From construction sites to stages where sound protection became more and more critical like the ability to preserve your hearing in deafening environments. In that world, active noise cancellation/reduction was created. Using the physics of sound to create sounds that destroy sounds, so the sounds you care about are clearer than ever.

				<h1>Unwanted Noises</h1>
				<p> We all live in a world where constant sounds surround us even in what we consider a quiet place, such as the sounds of cars driving by, the squeaking of doors, footsteps of yourself and others, even breathing. Among these noises of everyday life, there are some so irritating that there’s an emotional, even physical response to the point where we actively perceive it as unpleasant. In some extremities, the response can even evoke fight-or-flight among other things. This range of psychoacoustics is often called Misophonia, the hatred of sound. These can be the result of otherwise mundane things like “slurping, crunching, mouth noises, tongue clicking, sniffling, tapping, joint cracking, nail clipping, and the infamous nails on the chalkboard” as reported by a neurological survey.
				</p>
				<p>So why do these emotional responses happen? Well all auditory processing eventually happens in the brain, particularly with the auditory cortex (see figure below) which is working in conjunction with our emotion processing amygdala. What happens is that when the brain hears a perceived unpleasant sound is that the amygdala interacts once again to enhance focus on what was heard and evokes a negative response to that sensitivity.
				</p>

				<p>Now, why are some sounds annoying while others can be ignored passively or even enjoy? Well, research conducted acoustically showed that the most common irritating sounds, such as the scraping of a nail on a chalkboard, are usually found within the range of 2000-5000 Hz. This has been determined to be the frequencies human ears are most sensitive to, like a weak spot in the ears this shrill pitch incites a visceral reaction that most people, most minds, absolutely detest and will do what it can to avoid to silence it.

				<h1>Classical Techniques</h1>
				<p> Since the antiquities, our ancestors have produced music as ancient instruments dotted past cities, with it came a concern and a disease. “What if we lost our hearing” this fear was fully realized when Europe turned on each other in The Great War. In the first war that fully utilized machine guns, artilleries, and other potent explosives, the hearing loss came hand in hand with mechanized warfare. In those trenches, the first hearing protection came in the form of earplugs, created less than a century before but popularized in these battles. They came in the form of specialized gauzes, meant to mimic thick cotton that absorbs the energy of the sound waves while improving clarity. In the demonstration below we tried to mimic this technique to the best of our ability to see how effective it is to noise and other nuisance sounds.

				<p>While accomplishing this is sadly underwhelming. The noise reduction did have some effect but the peaks still shined through as reflected by its lacklustre construction. </p>

				<h1>Modern Techniques</h1>
				<p>The urge to manipulate and correct our imperfect world drives us to further develop and better our perceived environment. With the evolution of sound creation moving into the digital era, where sounds can be mathematically approximated as close as can be to what is originally heard in a live setting, the tools for manipulating sound waves have increased in versatility and quality. So what are the known techniques with the need to generate silence in digital media? Well, there is a noise-cancelling technique known as Active Noise Cancellation/Reduction (ANC/ANR), where given an original sound, a sound wave with a similar amplitude but with its phase inverted it is fed to the original. This creates destructive interference that cancels the sounds out. Presently, we have algorithms developed to analyze the original’s background noise to have this happen automatically.
				</p>

				<p>One product of these efforts is the Beats headphones, which were tested with four different ambient noises: continuous, intermittent, impulsive, and low-frequency to fully examine the effects of noise reduction, put together on top of a song, as shown above. The Beats’ headphones use Active Noise Cancellation as described, with the added functionality of also adjusting the degree of the cancellation based on the way they physically sit on your head. As shown by the results of our test with the ANC on, the amount of noise overall produced is significantly reduced using this method.
				</p>

				<p>An even more technologically recent advancement is Krisp, a noise-cancelling application made originally when making live calls. What’s amazing in particular is that only one side has to have the app active for the noise cancelling to work on both ends, while analyzing which part of the noise is a human voice all of which is processed by an AI. Using the same sample of implantation as the Beats’ method, we recorded a control and app-affected sample over a discord call to see whether it could pick out the original sample’s voice. As you can see between the difference between the original and the Krisp version, even the music from the sample was stripped out leaving only the voice.
				</p>
				<p>Overall it’s easy to see those technological efforts to keep sounds CRISP and noise-free are developing a tool with malleability, increasing quality and ease of access for our comfort.

				<h1>Epilogue</h1>
				<p>The sound comes in all forms, wanted or not, felt or not, as time passes we clear the line between what is noise and what isn’t, what should be heard and what should be scrubbed. Music does sound better without noise polluting it but at what cost should we achieve it at what point do the small mishaps and the background noise from the recording studios add to a song's “timbre”? The battle to perfect silence is still ongoing, much like the shadow metaphor, to create a perfectly darkened shadow against the sun is a titanic task, the technology needed to perfectly eliminate noise from our everyday life may exist but finding it is still years away. But a final question. Why should we strive to create silence? To strip away the ambiance of a place? What is a cafe without overlapping chatter, what is a city without traffic, what is a forest without branch shake and birdsongs, what is life without noise?
